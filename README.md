- Challenge description:

In this playground competition, you’re challenged to build a toy matching algorithm that maximizes happiness by pairing kids with toys they want. In the dataset, each kid has 10 preferences for their gift (from 1000) and Santa has 1000 preferred kids for every gift available. What makes this extra difficult is that 0.4% of the kids are twins, and by their parents’ request, require the same gift.

- Absolutely a algorithm problem, using `c++` to solve.
